<h1>GETTING STARTED </h1>
E-Commerce WebSite made using HTML CSS and Vanilla JavaScript.
The Project demonstartes some of the basic yet important features of an E-Commerce Website which is only the tip of an iceberg.
The WebSite is compatible with all the mobile devices and is completely Responsive. 
Project might (certainly does) have bugs, vulnerabilities or has some of the features missing so contributions are always welcome. I look forward to update the 
project once I learn more about Web Development.
The project is under free hosting using Google FireBase, so it may require patience :)
